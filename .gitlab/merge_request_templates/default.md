# Code Review Checklist

## General

- [ ] Code follows the requirements and specifications outlined in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

## Code Structure and Organization

- [ ] Code has a clear structure, divided into components, pages, and modules.
- [ ] Proper directory structure is used, such as `components`, `pages`, `styles`, `utils`, etc.

## Component Usage

- [ ] Components from MUI are used consistently and appropriately throughout the project.
- [ ] Custom components follow best practices and are reusable where applicable.
- [ ] The code avoids unnecessary nesting of components and keeps the component hierarchy simple.

## Code Quality and Best Practices

- [ ] The code follows consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.
- [ ] Proper indentation and formatting are used for improved readability.
- [ ] Redundant or unused code is removed.
- [ ] The code avoids long and complex functions, favoring modularity and separation of concerns.
- [ ] Comments are used effectively to explain complex logic or important considerations.
- [ ] Error handling is implemented properly, with meaningful error messages and appropriate error boundaries.

## State Management

- [ ] State is managed using React's built-in state or appropriate state management libraries like Redux or Recoil.
- [ ] The use of global state is justified, and local component state is preferred where appropriate.
- [ ] The state is updated immutably to prevent unexpected side effects.

## Data Fetching

- [ ] Data fetching is implemented using Next.js data fetching methods like `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or `useSWR`.
- [ ] API calls and data manipulation are handled properly, considering error handling and loading states.
